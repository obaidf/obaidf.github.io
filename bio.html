<h1> Bio | Obaid Farooqui </h1>
<br>
<div> I'm a Computer Science major at Tufts University. <br>
 I was born in India and raised in New England, and I <br> 
 really like snow. I'm a tech and chocolate enthusiast, <br>
 and YouTube is my favorite website. When I'm not <br> 
 coding I like to explore random side streets and take <br> 
 artsy pictures.</div>
