<h1> Bio | Obaid Farooqui </h1>
<br>

<p> I was born in India but raised in New England,  <br>
 where I have lived nearly all of my life. I am the  <br>
eldest of four, and arguably the second youngest of heart. </p>

<p> I'm a Computer Science major at Tufts University. <br>
  I'm a tech and chocolate enthusiast, <br>
 and YouTube is my favorite website. When I'm not <br> 
 coding I like to explore random side streets and take <br> 
 artsy pictures.</p>
